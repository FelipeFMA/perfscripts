### perfscripts âš¡
These scripts function similarly to power profiles but without unnecessary bloat.
I have placed them in the /usr/bin directory, allowing me to simply type perf in
the terminal to achieve maximum performance effortlessly. Additionally, you can
automate the process by configuring the system to execute eco mode automatically
when on battery power and switch to perf mode when connected to AC power.

Warning: These scripts have been specifically tailored for my laptop. You must
adjust the parameters to match the specifications of your GPU and CPU for them
to function correctly on your device.
